 * ---- One board, many tabs ----
 *
 * Every page here reconnects to an already authorised board on load. Open two of
 * them and the second open takes the port from the first, which is then told
 * "The device has been lost" on its next read — an error that reads like a
 * hardware fault and is not one. What follows is worse: the page blames the
 * wiring, and the search goes to the sensor.
 *
 * So tabs tell each other. A page holding the port answers when another asks,
 * and a page reconnecting by itself stands down instead of taking it. Standing
 * down is the only option either way: measured in Chrome, a second open fails
 * with "Failed to open serial port" rather than taking the board, so the other
 * tab has to let go first. reason() turns that bare failure into what to do
 * about it.
 *
 * The terminal and the sensor pages share the channel, so it does not matter
 * which of them holds the board.

   * The Melexis IO board reads DTR as "something is attached": asserted turns
   * its LED green, released turns it red, and nothing else about its behaviour
   * changes. RTS it ignores, and its USB CDC accepts any line coding. So here
   * this is what makes the LED go red when a page disconnects, instead of
   * leaving it green until the browser gets round to dropping the line.
   *
   * The order matters elsewhere. On a devkit where DTR and RTS drive EN and
   * GPIO0 through the auto-reset transistors, RTS asserted while DTR is
   * released holds EN low, so dropping DTR on its own resets the part.
   * MIPTerminal learned that the expensive way (mip/mip.py) and drops RTS
   * first; a browser drops both at close in an order of its own, so the pages
   * settle it themselves beforehand.
   *
   * What a browser cannot do is open with the lines already down, which is how
   * MIPTerminal opens an ESP32 (CubeProgrammer/worker.py) so that the open
   * itself does not reset the board. Measured here on an ESP32-S3, a C3 and a
   * C6 — all of them 303a:1001, which is why the vendor alone identifies them —
   * and an ordinary open leaves every one running: the USB device number does
   * not change, because the reset needs a sequence on those lines rather than a
   * raised level. A devkit with a bridge and auto-reset
   * transistors is the case where an open does reset the part, and there a
   * page has no lever at all.
