# MLX90396 Multi-Demo Platform — Application Note (Web GUI)

A browser-based dashboard and diagnostic toolkit for the **Melexis MLX90396** 3D Hall-effect
magnetic sensor. Everything runs client-side in a Chromium browser (Chrome / Edge) over the
**Web Serial API** — no backend server, no native driver install. The GUI visualizes the
magnetic field live on three views (Joystick, Twist, 3D Plot), exposes the Twist-mode signal
math and calibration, and drives a third.js SFI dome visual.

> **Browser requirement:** Web Serial is implemented by **Chrome and Edge (desktop)** only.
> Firefox and Safari do not provide `navigator.serial` — the GUI detects this, disables the
> "Open Serial Port" button, and shows a clear message. The page must also run in a secure
> context (`https://` or `http://localhost`).

## 1. System Architecture & Data Paths

```
        Browser (this GUI)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Joystick view · Twist view · 3D Plot view   │
   └──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                          │ Web Serial API

                          │
           Bridge MCU → SPI → MLX90396  (SCPI path)
           Arduino MCU → frame stream  (Arduino path)
           —————————————  Emulation      (no hardware)
```

Three interchangeable data sources feed the same UI pipeline (`app.js`):

| Path | Driver in modal | Data origin | Latency in live loop |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SCPI Bridge** (`scpi`) | `mlx_api.js` (`MLX90396_API`) | Raw 4-pixel register reads over SCPI-tunneled SPI | 50 ms sample (20 Hz) |
| **Direct Arduino** (`arduino`) | `arduino_api.js` (`Arduino_API`) | Firmware telemetry frame stream (angle from on-MCU TFLite model) | 25 ms sample (40 Hz) |
| **Emulation** (no connection) | n/a | Synthetic Lissajous signal | ~33 ms (30 Hz) |

**Emulation mode** activates automatically when **Start** is pressed while no serial device is
connected, so the full UI can be exercised without hardware.

## 2. Main Toolbar

| Control | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Begins the live demo loop. Enabled out of the box (this is how you reach the built-in emulator without hardware); after a connect/disconnect cycle it is disabled until a device is connected again. |
| **Stop** | Halts the loop, recentres joystick/magnet disk, demo status → Idle. |
| **Status badge** | `Idle` / `Running` / `Error`. |
| **Connect USB** | Toggles **Disconnect** when connected; otherwise opens the connection modal. |

## 3. Connection Modal

Opened by **Connect USB**. Chooses the driver, serial settings, and SPI bus *before* the
Chrome port picker appears.

- **Target Device Driver**
  - `SCPI Bridge (MLX90396 SPI API)` — full register/NVRAM + raw pixel control through the
    bridge firmware's SCPI tunnel (`:SPI:WriteReaD`, `:SPI:CS0`, `:SPI:Init`, `:VDD:3V3`, …).
  - `Direct Arduino Telemetry (Frame Stream)` — passive consumer of the Arduino's
    pipe-delimited frame telemetry (no SCPI / NVRAM controls; those stay disabled).
- **Serial Baud Rate** — 115200 (default), 230400, 500000, 9600.
- **SPI Bus Type** (SCPI only)
  - `:SPI` — **Cable Connection**; initializes `:CON:CS1:GPIO:INIT:OUT 0` and
    `:SPI:BUFfer 1,1,1,1,0`.
  - `:SPI2` — **Header Connection**; initializes `:SPI2:Init 0`, `:SPI2:SET:CS0 0`,
    and `:A3:GPIO:INIT:OUT 0`.
- **Browser-Authorized Ports** — shows previously-permitted ports as
  `Serial Port · VID 0xXXXX · PID 0xXXXX` (generic — no hardcoded VID→name table).
- **Open Serial Port** — calls `navigator.serial.requestPort()` with **no device filters**:
  the Chrome picker lists every serial device Windows detects.

**Error handling:** failures keep the modal open and display a visible `#connect-error`
message. "Failed to open serial port" maps to an actionable hint (another program holds the
port — close Arduino IDE Serial Monitor / vendor tools, replug). Unsupported browsers get an
explicit message instead of a silent failure. All diagnostics are also mirrored to the
browser DevTools console (there is no on-screen terminal window).

---

## 4. View 1 — Joystick

`view-joystick` (active sub-tab by default).

- **3D stick** — CSS-variable driven (`--tx`, `--ty`): translational offset plus
  `rotateX/rotateY` tilt. Fed by `rawX/20, rawY/20`; stick radius is clamped to a max of
  50 units.
- **28-LED radial ring** — 360°/28 ≈ 12.86° per LED. The LED nearest the vector **angle**
  lights `led-active` with a ±2-LED falloff (`led-low-1`, `led-low-2`). Active only when the
  deviation from center is > 5 units.
- **Radar Scope** (canvas) — polar blips plot the vector trail (last 40 points), plus a
  gradient vector line from center, a live dot (with glow) when off-center, concentric
  range rings, and compass labels. Readout: `Azimuth · Range`, where
  `Azimuth = atan2(-y, x)` (0° at +X, increasing counter-clockwise per the canvas
  y-down convention) and range is reported as % of 50.

---

## 5. View 2 — Twist

`view-magnet` — the diametrical twist demo. A half-blue/half-red magnet disk
(blue = N, red = S) rides a 1 mm grid printed on a stylized sensor overlay over a **PCB**
schematic.

**Rendering**
- Grid is **fixed at ±2.5 mm** — it never auto-ranges. Earlier builds rescaled the map from
  live peak tracking, which made the disk appear to "jump" during a pure rotation; that was
  removed. `gridHalfPx()` reads the sensor element's live `clientWidth/2`, so
  `pxPerMm = halfPx / 2.5` adapts to window size without changing the physical meaning.
- XY position becomes `translate3d(transX, transY, 0)`, clamped to the grid edges.
- Twist angle becomes `rotate(-angle)` — the sign is deliberately inverted so a **rightward
  (CW) physical rotation renders as clockwise on screen** (CSS counts + as CW, but the raw
  device angle grows the other way).
- Both XY and angle pass through an **EMA filter** (`ALPHA = 0.4`) so tremor and model
  fuzz glide instead of snapping; the same filter runs on all modes.

**Controls**
- **Zero Position** — captures the current raw position as the offset
  (`magnetOffsets.x/y`); the disk recentres. Reported over console.
- **Lock XY (twist only)** — freezes `transX/transY` at center while the angle keeps
  rotating. Use this to demonstrate a pure twist around the magnet axis, isolating rotation
  from position. The internal EMA keeps tracking, so unchecking never snaps.
- **Signal & Calibration** — toggles the `#twist-panel` with live readouts and calibration
  inputs (below).

### Twist panel — live signal

Six readouts (updating only while the Twist tab is active and the panel is open):

1. **Alpha (calibrated)** — Desmos-calibrated twist angle about the X axis, degrees.
2. **Beta (calibrated)** — Desmos-calibrated twist angle about the Y axis, degrees.
3. **Alpha (raw)** — raw `atan2` angle, degrees.
4. **Beta (raw)** — raw `atan2` angle, degrees.
5. **Alpha Strength** — `sqrt(Z² + X²)` (1px) or `sqrt(Z02² + X02²)` (2px), in the mode's unit.
6. **Beta Strength** — `sqrt(Z² + Y²)` (1px) or `sqrt(Z13² + Y13²)` (2px), in the mode's unit.

### Twist panel — mode selector

- **1px mode (single pixel · mT)** — uses pixel **0**: `X0, Y0, Z0`.
  `Alpha = atan2(Z0, X0)`, `Beta = atan2(Z0, Y0)`.
- **2px mode (differential · mT/mm)** — uses the differences between pixel pairs:
  `X02 = (x2 − x0)/2`, `Z02 = (z2 − z0)/2`, `Y13 = (y3 − y1)/2`, `Z13 = (z3 − z1)/2`.
  `Alpha = atan2(Z02, X02)`, `Beta = atan2(Z13, Y13)`. Cross-terms in the calibration
  consume the *other* axis' differential pair (alpha sees `Y13`, beta sees `X02`).

### Twist panel — gain & calibration config

- **GAINSEL (electrical gain)** — 0–63 register value, applied per mode through
  `twist_api.js` `setGainSel`. Defaults: `1px = 37 (0b100101)` (boosted gain ≈ 219),
  `2px = 9 (0b001001)` (kept stock until hardware trim). The hint text shows the current
  value and its 6-bit pattern live.
- **Calibration constants** `k1, k2, o11, o12, o21, o22` — edited live; every change
  re-renders the readouts immediately. They feed the Desmos cross-axis model:

  ```
  a1 = atan2( sqrt(z1² + (k1·(y1 − o11·z1))²), (x1 − o12·z1) )
  b1 = atan2( sqrt(z1² + (k2·(x1 − o21·z1))²), (y1 − o22·z1) )
  ```

  **Default = identity no-op.** With `k1 = k2 = 1, o11…o22 = 0` the calibrated readout is
  *exactly* the raw `atan2` — no tangential cross-axis mixing — so "clean" vanilla readings
  are shown until you actually enter offsets/gains.

## 6. View 3 — 3D Plot

`view-3dplot` — live Plotly `scatter3d` of the field vector components
`(Bx, By, Bz)` on axes fixed at ±1000 with 250-unit ticks.

- **Live ball** — current sample.
- **Trail** — last 60 samples as a connected line.
- **Reset Trail** — clears the history (data keeps streaming).
- The plot only redraws while this tab is the active view (performance); data continues to
  accumulate in the history buffer regardless.

---

## 7. How Each Data Source Feeds the GUI

### SCPI path (`scpi`)
Per loop iteration (~50 ms):
1. `sm(0xFC000)` + 15 ms settle → `rm(false, 0xFC000)` reads pixels **0–1**
   (`x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1`).
2. `sm(0x03F00)` + 15 ms settle → `rm(false, 0x03F00)` reads pixels **2–3**
   (`x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3`).
3. Averages of the four pixels become `avgX, avgY, avgZ`.
4. `angleDeg = atan2(-avgY, avgX)` (sign convention tuned for the demo orientation).
5. Position is derived from **gradients** with crosstalk removal:
   `rawGradX = ((x1+x2) − (x0+x3))/2`, `rawGradY = ((y0+y1) − (y3+y2))/2`,
   `cleanGradX = rawGradX − avgX·K_ROT_X`, `cleanGradY = rawGradY − avgY·K_ROT_Y`
   (`K_ROT = 0.10`), finishing with `mm = cleanGrad · SCALE` (`SCALE = 0.02`).
6. All four pixels are passed to `updateTwistUI` for the Twist panel.

### Arduino path (`arduino`)
The 15-field frame is parsed by `Arduino_API.parseLine`:

```
x0|y0|z0|x1|y1|z1|x2|y2|z2|x3|y3|z3|X_mm|Y_mm|angle
```

`X_mm / Y_mm` are the firmware's position estimate (mm) and `angle` is degrees **as computed
on the MCU** (TFLite model — fuzzy by nature). `rawX/Y/Z` here are the simple mean of the
four pixels. A legacy 6-field frame (`posX,posY,angle,rawX,rawY,rawZ`) is also accepted.
Position/angle are then offset by "Zero Position" and rendered identically to the other paths.

### Emulation path
Generates a Lissajous: `emulatedX = sin(a·0.7)·1.8`, `emulatedY = cos(a·0.9)·1.8`,
`emulatedAngle = a`. Feed the same UI functions; the Twist panel receives a synthetic rotating
4-pixel field (two sine-driven in-plane components + constant Z bias).

---

## 8. Data / Signal-Path Notes

- **Only the active view animates.** Every render function starts with
  `isViewActive(...)`, so off-screen widgets do no DOM/Plotly work.
- **Grid is static** (±2.5 mm fixed range, ±1 mm grid, corner labels ±2.5 mm highlighted).
  No auto-ranging.
- **Rotation sign:** GUI renders `rotate(-angle)` so physical CW twist → on-screen CW.
  If the MCU convention changes, flip the sign at that single render line.
- **Jitter handling:** EMA smoothing (`ALPHA 0.4`) is the only damping; the wobble you still
  see under a pure twist is real data — TFLite model output fuzz, mechanical play in the
  printed rig, and hand tremor over a ±2.5 mm travel — not a mapping bug.

---

## 9. Inactive/Unreachable Views (present in markup, no tab exposes them)

- **`view-calib` — Joystick Calibration Wizard** (steps: capture zero, boundary sweep,
  deadband filter, apply) with a Bx-vs-By motion trace canvas and telemetry offsets/span.
  Its zero/sweep/save buttons are HTML-enabled only via an **SFI demo tab** that is not
  wired into the current toolbar.
- **`view-memory` — NVRAM register editor** (read/write 16-bit words, full 0x00–0x3F dump,
  Store/Recall). Controls enable only in **SCPI** mode. Reachable only from a legacy SFI UI.

Both remain functional if a future tab navigator is added; they are simply not routed today.
